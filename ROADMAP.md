# QubitOS Development Roadmap

## Overview

QubitOS is an open-source quantum control kernel providing Hamiltonian-level pulse optimization, hardware abstraction, and calibration management for quantum computing research. The project spans three repositories: `qubit-os-proto` (Protocol Buffer definitions), `qubit-os-hardware` (Rust HAL server), and `qubit-os-core` (Python client, optimizer, and calibration). **v0.1.0 has been released** — this roadmap now focuses on v0.2.0 foundation hardening informed by a comprehensive architecture review.

---

## CI/CD-First Development Policy

**All development follows a CI/CD-first approach. This is not negotiable.**

### The CI/CD Contract

1. **Green CI is a prerequisite for any phase transition**
   - No phase can begin until the previous phase's CI is passing
   - No commits to main branch if CI is red (except CI fixes)

2. **Local validation before push**
   - Run `scripts/ci-check.sh` before every push
   - Pre-commit hooks must be installed and active

3. **No bypassing branch protection**
   - Branch protection rules exist for a reason
   - If you must bypass, you MUST fix CI in the next commit

### Quick Reference: CI Check Commands

```bash
# qubit-os-hardware
cd qubit-os-hardware
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test

# qubit-os-core
cd qubit-os-core
source .venv/bin/activate
ruff check src/ && ruff format --check src/ && pytest tests/

# qubit-os-proto
cd qubit-os-proto
buf lint && buf format -d --exit-code
python -m build  # Test Python build works
```

## Completed Phases (v0.1.0)

### Phase 0: Design & Foundation ✅

Established project structure and governance: design document v0.5.0 defining the Hamiltonian-first architecture, 3-repo structure (proto, hardware, core), Protocol Buffer API definitions, CI/CD workflows for all repos, default calibration data, README files, Apache 2.0 licensing, pre-commit hooks, issue templates, and Dependabot configuration.

### Phase 1: Core Implementation ✅

Built the working single-qubit control stack: Rust HAL server (tonic gRPC + axum REST), QuTiP simulation backend via PyO3, GRAPE optimizer achieving 99.9% fidelity on X-gate, full `qubit-os` CLI, Python client library, and completed a 12-item security audit. End-to-end test passing: X-gate optimization through pulse execution to measurement results.

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing ✅

Achieved production-quality test coverage and documentation: 93% Python coverage (464 tests), 85%+ Rust coverage (149 tests), MkDocs documentation site, 3 tutorial notebooks (quickstart, GRAPE deep dive, custom Hamiltonians), 5 golden file test suites for reproducibility validation, mypy clean, troubleshooting guide, and API reference (Sphinx, rustdoc, OpenAPI, buf).

### Phase 3: IQM Integration ✅

Connected to real quantum hardware: IQM Resonance API client in Rust with exponential backoff retry and SecretString credential handling, Hellinger distance crosscheck validation between simulation and hardware, T1/T2 fitting from hardware measurements, randomized benchmarking with 24 single-qubit Cliffords (BFS over generators), and automated calibration runner with drift detection via fingerprinting.

### Phase 4: v0.1.0 Release ✅

Published the first release: v0.1.0 tagged across all three repositories, CHANGELOGs finalized, Python package published to PyPI, Docker images pushed to GHCR, documentation site deployed, and release notes written.

## v0.2.0 — Foundation Hardening

**Theme:** Address structural gaps before scaling to multi-qubit.

The [architecture review](ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md) identified five structural gaps in QubitOS. While the current single-qubit stack is solid, multi-qubit expansion (v0.3.0) will amplify these gaps into serious problems: temporal constraints between qubits require a time model (GAP 1), sequence-level fidelity requires cumulative error tracking (GAP 2), and gate-model thinking in the API will confuse the Hamiltonian-first design intent (GAP 5). This phase hardens the foundations before building the next floor.

### Design Specifications

| Spec File | Title | GAP |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `specs/time-model.md` | Time Model & Temporal Constraints | GAP 1 |
| `specs/error-budget.md` | Error Budget System | GAP 2 |
| `specs/target-unitary.md` | Hamiltonian-First API Restructure | GAP 5 |
| `specs/provenance-tree.md` | Experiment Provenance Merkle Tree | GAP 4 |
| `specs/proto-consistency.md` | Proto/Python Consistency Fixes | — |

---

### 0.2.1 Time Model & Temporal Constraints

**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimate:** 4–6 weeks | **Addresses:** GAP 1

#### Deliverables

- [x] `TimePoint` type with `nominal_ns`, `precision_ns`, and `jitter_bound_ns` fields
- [x] `TemporalConstraint` system supporting `Simultaneous`, `Sequential`, `Aligned`, and `MaxDelay` constraint kinds
- [x] `PulseSequence` data structure with constraint validation at construction time
- [x] `DecoherenceBudget` tracking cumulative T1/T2 consumption across a pulse sequence
- [x] AWG clock alignment: pulse durations quantized to AWG sample period (integer multiples)
- [x] Proto extensions: `TimePoint`, `TemporalConstraint`, `PulseSequence`, and `DecoherenceBudget` messages in `quantum.pulse.v1`
- [ ] Rust-side temporal constraint validation in HAL server (reject invalid sequences before execution)
- [x] Python `PulseSequence` builder with decoherence budget warnings at construction time
- [x] Fix `duration_ns` type mismatch: proto defines `int32`, Python uses `float` — unify via `TimePoint`
- [x] Integration tests: constraint violation detection, AWG alignment enforcement, decoherence budget warnings, round-trip proto serialization

#### Exit Criteria

- [x] Timing relationships between pulses are expressible in the API (simultaneous, sequential, aligned, max-delay)
- [x] Construction-time warning when cumulative sequence duration exceeds configurable fraction of T2
- [x] AWG clock alignment validated and enforced (non-aligned durations rejected or rounded with warning)
- [x] All existing tests pass (backward compatible — `PulseShape` without constraints still works)

---

### 0.2.2 Error Budget System

**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimate:** 3–4 weeks | **Addresses:** GAP 2

#### Deliverables

- [x] `ErrorBudget` dataclass tracking cumulative infidelity, decoherence cost, leakage estimate, and crosstalk penalty
- [x] `projected_fidelity()` method estimating total sequence fidelity from accumulated errors
- [x] `can_append()` check: returns whether appending a gate/pulse stays within the remaining error budget
- [x] Configurable warning thresholds (default: warn at 50% budget consumed, reject at 90%)
- [x] Integration with `PulseSequence`: error budget updated automatically as pulses are appended
- [x] Integration with calibration T1/T2 data: decoherence cost computed from measured coherence times
- [ ] CLI output showing error budget status after optimization and before execution
- [x] Proto extensions: `ErrorBudget` message, `projected_fidelity` field on `MeasurementResult`
- [x] Unit tests validating error accumulation math (multiplicative fidelity, additive infidelity bounds, decoherence decay)

#### Exit Criteria

- [x] Cumulative error tracked across pulse sequences (not just per-gate pass/fail)
- [ ] Projected fidelity shown to user before execution (CLI and Python API)
- [x] Decoherence cost computed from calibrated T1/T2 values (not hardcoded)
- [x] Warning thresholds configurable and documented

---

### 0.2.3 Hamiltonian-First API Restructure

**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Estimate:** 2–3 weeks | **Addresses:** GAP 5

#### Deliverables

- [x] Rename `GateType` → `TargetUnitary` across all three repos (proto enum, Python enum, Rust enum)
- [x] Deprecation alias: `GateType = TargetUnitary` with `DeprecationWarning` in Python, maintained for one release cycle (removed in v0.3.0)
- [x] Sync enum values: add `S`, `T`, `SQISWAP`, `SWAP`, `CX` to Python `TargetUnitary` to match proto definition
- [x] Restructure documentation: Hamiltonian/pulse examples are the primary path, gate convenience is secondary
- [ ] Update quickstart guide: lead with `HamiltonianSpec` + Pauli string, show `TargetUnitary` as shortcut
- [ ] Update all 3 tutorial notebooks to use Hamiltonian-first examples
- [ ] Reconcile duplicate v0.5.0 design docs (root copy vs `core/docs/specs/` copy) — single source of truth
- [ ] Reconcile generated code policy (committed vs build-time) — document the decision

#### Exit Criteria

- [x] Single `TargetUnitary` enum used everywhere (proto, Python, Rust)
- [x] Documentation and tutorials lead with Hamiltonian/pulse-level thinking
- [x] `GateType` still works but emits deprecation warning
- [ ] No duplicate design specifications — single source of truth established

---

### 0.2.4 Experiment Provenance / Merkle Tree

**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Estimate:** 2–3 weeks | **Addresses:** GAP 4

#### Deliverables

- [x] Merkle tree node types: `CalibrationNode`, `PulseSequenceNode`, `GRAPEConfigNode`, `SoftwareVersionNode`
- [x] Root hash computed from tree and attached to every `MeasurementResult`
- [x] `diff(hash_a, hash_b)` function identifying which tree nodes changed between two experiment runs
- [x] Integration with existing `FingerprintStore`: calibration fingerprint becomes a subtree
- [ ] Proto extensions: `ProvenanceTree` message, `provenance_hash` field on `MeasurementResult`
- [x] Storage format: JSON-serializable tree structure for archival and comparison
- [ ] Python API: `experiment.provenance()` returns the full tree; `experiment.diff(other)` returns changed nodes
- [x] Unit tests: tree construction, hash stability, diff correctness, subtree isolation

#### Exit Criteria

- [x] Provenance hash present on all `MeasurementResult` objects
- [x] `diff()` correctly identifies which parameters changed between two experiments
- [x] Tree covers calibration, pulse sequence, GRAPE config, and software versions
- [x] Backward compatible: results without provenance hash still work (hash field is optional)

---

### 0.2.5 Proto/Python Consistency Fixes

**Priority:** LOW | **Estimate:** 1 week

#### Deliverables

- [x] `duration_ns` type alignment between proto (`int32`) and Python (`float`) — resolved by time model `TimePoint` adoption
- [ ] Populate `PulseShape` provenance fields (`calibration_hash`, `optimizer_version`) from `GrapeResult` metadata
- [ ] `GrapeResult` → `PulseShape` serialization layer: clean conversion with all fields populated
- [ ] Sparse COO matrix format support in Python Hamiltonian parser (for large multi-qubit Hamiltonians)
- [ ] Round-trip proto serialization tests: Python → proto → Python for all message types

---

### 0.2.6 Technical Debt Cleanup

**Priority:** LOW | **Estimate:** 1–2 weeks

#### Deliverables

- [ ] Fix 3 missing file I/O error handlers in `calibrator/loader.py` (identified in QUALITY_GATES.md)
- [ ] Empty list guard in `hamiltonians.py:tensor_product` (currently undefined behavior on empty input)
- [ ] `NoisyMockBackend` for statistical validation testing (returns slightly different results each call, simulating shot noise)
- [x] Symplectic Clifford representation research (Aaronson & Gottesman 2004) — research note only, no implementation (needed for multi-qubit RB in v0.3.0)
- [ ] Physics-aware validation warnings: pulse durations shorter than a single Rabi cycle, drive amplitudes that would excite higher transmon levels
- [ ] Ensure broad `except Exception` handlers in CLI code do not leak into library or HAL layers
- [ ] Update QUALITY_GATES.md to reflect resolved items and new quality standards
